                    <li> Income is earned from dividends 
                      on stocks and interest on bonds. A fund pays out nearly 
                      all income it receives over the year to fund owners 
                      in the form of a distribution. </li>
                    <li> If the fund sells securities that 
                      have increased in price, the fund has a capital Gain. 
                      Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in 
                      a distribution. </li>
                    <li> If fund holdings increase in price 
                      but are not sold by the fund manager, the fund's shares 
                      increase in price. You can then sell your mutual fund 
                      shares for a profit. </li>
