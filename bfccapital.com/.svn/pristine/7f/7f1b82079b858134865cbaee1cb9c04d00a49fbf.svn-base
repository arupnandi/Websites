It is referred to as a 'third-party' cover since the beneficiary of  the policy is not the two parties involved in the contract -- the insured and  the insurance company.<br />
                  It  covers the injuries to a third person, or damage to the third person's assets.  But, it is better to go for a comprehensive motor insurance.<br />
                  You  can negotiate for a discount while buying. Also, soon general insurers would be  able to price the premium on the policy wordings. <br /></td>

For now, look for  lower rates without compromising on any of the clauses or feature.<br />
                  Always  remember, to transfer your no-claim bonus to the new car, if you are replacing  your old one. This way, you would be able to save 20-50 per cent on the first  premium of your new car.</span></td>

Home insurance not only covers your dwelling  against unpredictable events, such as a terrorist attack or an earthquake, but  also your valuable personal property, such as consumer durables and jewellery. <br />
                  The  premium is less than 1 per cent of the actual cost of the contents or structure  covered. You can also opt for a long-term cover by paying a lumpsum premium. In  terms of cost, the policy gives you two choices -- cover against the present  market value and against the reinstatement value, or the value at the time of  the claim. Opt for the latter.<br />
                  You  can either opt for a standalone fire insurance policy (FIP), or a more  inclusive householder package policy (HHP). <br /></td>

HPP even offers other covers like public liability due to your  negligence, personal accident (offers an income stream for the period you are  temporarily disabled and a lumpsum payment in the case of death or total  disability), workmen's compensation (covers you against injury or death of your  domestic help) and baggage loss.</td>
