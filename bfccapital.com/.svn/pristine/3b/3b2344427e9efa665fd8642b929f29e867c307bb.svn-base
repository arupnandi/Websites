                      <br />
                      Mutual Funds are compulsorily  registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) , which acts  as regulator of Mutual funds for the protection of Investors.<br />
                      <br />
                      When a person invests in a  particular scheme of mutual fund, the fund house allots what are called UNITS  to the investors, at a price that is fixed through a process approved by SEBI.  This price is based on the &ldquo;net asset value&rdquo;, in simple terms which is the  total value of investment in a scheme divided by the total number of units  issued to investors in the said scheme. Normally, NAV&rsquo;s are computed and  published on a daily basis.
