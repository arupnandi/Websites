                  <p align="justify">Signature verification is done by Mutual Funds to protect an   investor from losses. As such, Mutual Funds may follow extra due-diligence if   signatures are not matching, such as getting Bank attestation for such   transactions. This could be independent of the KYC procedure. </p>

                    If the KYC was completed by submitting the PAN,   the Acknowledgement obtained at that time can be enclosed along with the   Investment Application Form(s) / Transaction Slip(s) while investing for the   first time in every folio as the PAN number will be stated on the said   acknowledgement. You need not repeat the process now.<br />

                    If   the KYC was completed without submitting the PAN but with other proof of   identity documents, for such cases, CVL will send out a communication to the   respective investors requesting them to submit self attested copy of PAN card   for KYC compliance. </p></td>
