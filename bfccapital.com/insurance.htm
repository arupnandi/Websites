At the same time it's a very important part of your life and you must  know certain ground rules for making the right decisions in the New Year. Many of us consider insurance just another investment for tax saving. Our  day-to-day life is full of unpredictable risks for example loss of life, loss  of income, critical illness, disability etc. Insurance planning means figuring  out adequate cover against &quot;insurable risks&quot; and getting the maximum  out of the premium you pay. Tax exemption is just another aspect of it.
                  <p><strong>Having the right insurance cover gives you peace  of mind as it provides financial support in case of contingencies.</strong></p></td>

When your income ceases or falls insufficient either due to death, illness,  retirement or a major goal such as children's education or marriage, insurance  fills in the gap. On your death, the money received from term insurance  policies will provide a corpus with which the family can pay off debts, convert  dreams to reality and still lead a comfortable life. You must have seen cases  of non-working mothers or non-earning family members getting insured. It goes  against the fundamental principle of insurance. <br />
                  Therefore it's important that the breadwinner  covers the risks to his life and income, so that his family's quality of life  is not compromised after he is gone.</td>

                  </strong>Calculates the corpus required to take care of the family's future expenses  and goals. Inflation diminishes the value of money and hence expenses need to  be adjusted to inflation for calculation of protection required.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                  <br />
                  b) <strong>Human life value</strong><strong><br />
                    </strong>It is the economic value of an individual; the present value of all his or  her future income. Setting aside the part of income one spends on oneself, the  protection required through human life value calculates today's value of one's  income for the years till his or her retirement.<br />
                  <br />
                  c) <strong>Needs analysis</strong><strong><br />
                  </strong>In this method you calculate your needs by considering each of your  dependents and what financial milestones you want to achieve for them. The  needs may range from child education, marriage to repayment of loans. Next you  assess your current assets and investments and shortfall due to loss of life.  This gap in income can be filled up by insurance.</td>

Hence, it is advisable to take insurance till one's  retirement. However, when insurance is taken for protecting and saving towards  specific goals, then the tenure of the plan should match the years left for  meeting the goal.</td>

Any advisor needs an in-depth knowledge and  understanding and proper prioritization of all aspects of your life. The  probable duration of life, amount of security needed, present and future needs  / shortfalls and post retirement requirements are also essential pieces of  information to be collected. Knowledge of the &quot;markets&quot; / mutual  funds and economic climate coupled with comprehension and application of HLV  (human life value), expense protection, and corpus requirements for retirement  help in prescribing an effective solution. <br />
