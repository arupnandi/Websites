                    with repatriation benefits under the Direct Investment Scheme 
                    and sold through the Stock Exchange in India will require 
                    permission of Reserve Bank. Applications for necessary permission 
                    should be made by NRIs/OCBs to the Central Office of Reserve 
                    Bank in form TS 4 through the designated bank branch of 
                    an authorized dealer. In such cases, permission for sale/transfer 
                    of shares / bonds/ debentures acquired with the right of 
                    repatriation will be granted by Reserve Bank to the bank 
                    branch designated by the seller or to the authorized dealer, 
                    as the case may be, who may sell the holdings at the ruling 
                    market price through a stock exchange at any time within 
                    the validity of the permission.</p>
                  <p>While granting permission for sale/transfer, Reserve Bank 
                    will also authorize the designated branch/authorized dealer 
                    to credit the sale proceeds to the NRE or FCNR account of 
                    the seller or to remit them abroad subject to payment of 
                    taxes on capital gains, if any. Where the amount of capital 
                    gains tax is not immediately determinable, the designated 
                    branch/authorized dealer may allow repatriation of sale 
                    proceeds or credit thereof to the seller's NRE/FCNR account 
                    to the extent of the original cost of investment immediately 
                    on realization of the sale proceeds. The excess amount, 
                    if any, representing capital gain should be kept by the 
                    designated branch/authorized dealer in a separate NRO account 
                    of the seller or in a suspense account.</p>
                  <p>The designated branch/authorized dealer may allow withdrawal 
                    of this amount for credit to the NRE/FCNR account of the 
                    seller or remit it abroad, on production of necessary tax

                    Act 1961 and after deduction of income tax at source.</p>
